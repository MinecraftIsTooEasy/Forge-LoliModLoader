## For migrating from v1.x to v2.x
* There is a mod migrating tool in `net.xiaoyu233.fml.util.ModRemapper`. You can use this to migrate your compiled mod file quickly
* Remapping for source code is still in developing. You can currently use the migrated jar file as a reference to modify source code
* (Or just decompile the migrated jar to use as the new source)
